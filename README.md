# Advent of Code

From [Advent of Code about](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about) page:

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

I am a software engineer and I enjoy programming puzzles. I usually participate in coding challenges like Google Code, Facebook Hacker Cup and some HackerRank contests. A co-worker of mine mentioned Advent of Code and I started playing with it during last year's (2022) edition. That year I started solving the problems using Java, just to practice year.

This year (2023) I'm trying to learn golang and thought it would be a good idea to solve the [2021 Edition](https://adventofcode.com/2021) using that language. I went halfway through 2022 in java and I'm a few days in into the 2021 edition using golang. I'll post my progress here.
